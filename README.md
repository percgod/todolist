A simple and functional To-Do List application that allows you to add, complete, and delete tasks. All tasks are saved in the browser's localStorage, so they persist between sessions.

## Features
- Add new tasks by typing in the input field and clicking "Add" or pressing Enter
- Mark tasks as completed by clicking on them (they will be crossed out)
- Delete tasks using the "Delete" button
- All tasks are saved automatically and will be there when you return
